to walk through GIT

Here we are testing git workflow by :


- Modifying existing files
- Creating new files
- Commiting to a branch
- Updating Head before merging
- Trigger a pull request
- Ask for modifications and deny the request
- Approve the request and merge in respective branch
- Changing the branches locally
- Stashing changes locally
- Deleting branches safely
- Reverting the commits and merge back
 *
